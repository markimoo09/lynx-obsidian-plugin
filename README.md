# Lynx

Lynx is an obsidian plugin that takes care of formatting, organizing, enhancing, and extracting valuable information from your Obsidian Notes

## Features

-   Create AI Profiles: These profiles allow you to provide the context, prompt guidelines, what matters to you, how it should format it, what it should do, and how it should do it for each of your note files.
-   Selective Enhancement: Select a chunk of text that you want to be refined, summarized, or processed.
-   Safe Note Enhancement: After the selective enhancement, it will write the enhanced version below the selected text.
-   AI Chat: Beyond simple notes, turn your notes into a knwoledgebase that acts as a second brain
